I am now a senior undergraduate student at Zhejiang University City College (ZUCC). Meanwhile, I'm also a research assistant under the guidance of Prof. [Lin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=48cqMXkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (associated Professor at ZUCC, as well as a mentor of master students at Zhejiang University). Barring accidents, I should receive my B.Eng. Degree in the coming year. 

I used to have a research internship at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yujiu-Yang). Besides, I worked closely with Prof. [Soroush Vosoughi](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~soroush/) at Dartmouth College.

My main research fields include but are not limited to **Information Extraction** and **Pre-trained Language Model**. Recently, I study intensively in the **Emoion Analysis in conversation**.
