I am a first-year PhD student at Temple University, and I am glad to be supervised by Prof. [Wenpeng Yin](https://sites.google.com/site/yinwenpeng1987/). Before TU, I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University City College, advised by Prof. [Lin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=48cqMXkAAAAJ&hl=en).

My current research interest focuses on **Learning from Task Instructions**, but I am also familiar with **Information Extraction**, **Pre-trained Language Models**, and **Emotion Analysis**.

<!-- 
My research interests include but are not limited to . Recently, I have been studying **Emotion Analysis in Conversations** intensively. -->

- Oct. 2022: One paper accepted by EMNLP 2022.
- Jun. 2022: Two papers submitted to EMNLP 2022.
- May 2022: **I received several Ph.D. offers and chose Temple University finally.**   
- Jan. 2022: Awarded "Outstanding Technical Contribution Grant for OpenVINO" from Intel.
- Oct. 2021: I came to CUHK-SZ and recieved a research assistantship, advised by Prof. Yan Song.
