My name is Renze Lou ( *Ê•º‰ªÅÊ≥Ω* ), a first-year PhD student at Penn State University. I am glad to be supervised by Prof. [Wenpeng Yin](https://sites.google.com/site/yinwenpeng1987/). Before PSU, I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University City College, advised by Prof. [Lin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=48cqMXkAAAAJ&hl=en).

My current research interest focuses on **Large Language Models**, **Instruction Tuning** and **Agent** ü§ñ. <font color="#df1a7d">I am now actively seeking for <u>Research Internship in 2024</u>.</font> Appreciate any opportunities or referrals!

<!-- I am actively looking for research collaborators (no matter PhD, master, or undergraduate students). If you are interested, feel free to reach out via email ü§ó. -->


## Updates:
