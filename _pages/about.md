My name is Renze Lou ( *Ê•º‰ªÅÊ≥Ω* ), a third-year PhD student at Penn State University. I am glad to be supervised by Prof. [Wenpeng Yin](https://www.wenpengyin.org/). Before PSU, I got my B.Eng. degree from Zhejiang University City College.

<!-- was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University City College, advised by Prof. [Lin Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=48cqMXkAAAAJ&hl=en). -->

My current research interests cover **AI for Science**, **Instruction Tuning** and **Agent** ü§ñ. I am actively looking for research collaborators. If you are interested, feel free to reach out via email ü§ó.

<font color="#df1a7d">I am now seeking a <u>Research Internship position for summer 2025</u>.</font> Appreciate any opportunities or referrals!
